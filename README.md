# Test repo for dotgov-data

## Does not contain official .gov domain information
This repo supports the .gov registry team publishing [data about the .gov zone](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data). It's used to support format or other publication changes before they ship. It may include fake .gov domains! Unless you're part of our team, this repo probably won't be useful to you.

## For Developers
This code will capture output from current-full and current-federal endpoint generated by our staging environment. To check if the .csv output is correctly generated, look the commit history of the following files in dotgov-data-staging:
* [current-full-staging.csv](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data-staging/blob/main/current-full-staging.csv) – a CSV of all domains in the zone, including federal domains
* [current-federal-staging.csv](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data-staging/blob/main/current-federal-staging.csv) – a CSV of only federal domains in the zone
