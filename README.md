# .gov data for staging

This repo supports the .gov registry team publishing [data about the .gov zone](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data). It's used to support format or other publication changes before they ship. It may include fake .gov domains! Unless you're part of our team, this repo probably won't be useful to you.

**This repo doesn't accept pull requests on the zone file or current-{full,federal}.csv**. If you manage a domain in these files and notice that metadata about it is incorrect, sign into the [.gov registrar](https://get.gov) to correct it.
